//void GoFish::searchCards(std::string Player, int val);

/*This function is to search the opposing player's linked list for the desired value card and, if found, add the found
cards to the original players linked list. If no cards of the desired value are found in the opposing players linked list,
the player is required to draw from the pool of cards (automatically add deck.back() to Player 1's linked list).
What still needs implemented:

-before a card is deleted, it should be stored in a temporary location (i would suggest a queue or a vector),
which after the search is complete, those cards will be added to player 1's linked list.

-It would most likely be easiest to create a whole "addCard" function, that could be called to add cards to
each players linked list. It could be used in this function as well as in the dealCards function. It would be structured
as void addCard(std::string player, card* temp). Player is the players linked list it is meant to go into,
temp is the card you're adding.

-If a number occurs 4 times in the new linked list, a "book" has been formed, and should be stored, and those values
removed from the linked list.

-Additionally, this function needs to be implemented in the reverse. After the Player's turn is complete, it is
the computers turn. We will need to write a function to find which value is repeated most in the computers linked list
(look through past rec. and assignments for algorithm / function? ).
Then, we search player 1's linked list for that value and do the same thing as before.
